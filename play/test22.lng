# Illustrating the Pythagorean theorem
my a = 3;
my b = 4;
my c = 5;
my left = a**2 + b**2;
my right = c**2;
say "The hypotenuse of a rectangle triangle with the 
sides $a and $b is indeed $c, as $left = $right.";

/* Using floating-point numbers for 
computing the length of a circle */
my pi = 3.1415926;
my R = 7;
my c = 2 * pi * R;
say "The length of a circle of radius $R is $c.";

# A list of prime numbers

my data[] = 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31;
my nth = data[n];
say "$n th prime number is $nth.";
